## Overview and Origin
Corti is a company headquarted in Copenhagen, Denmark that is currently developing an AI named Audia for the medical field. The comapny was founded by Andreas Cleve in 2016. Andreas got the idea by realizing that doctors 
spend a lot of time with patients on the phone and then documenting all the info they gathered. So, in order to reduce the time Doctors had to spend on data entry and spend more time with patients, Andreas created Audia, 
which listens in on phone calls with patients, transcribes everything that is said, and then sorts all the information gathered for medical staff to refer to. Corti was funded by Prosus Ventures, Atomico, Eurazeo, EIFO, and a former Dansih tabacco company for a toal of $60 million. However, the comapny has recieved a total of $87.16 million in funding since its creation. 

## Business Activities
The Public Safety industry is currently facing challenges of recruiting and retaining qualified personael. This negatively impacts the quality of emergency calls. So in order to help with this issue Corti implenting AI 
into these calls in order to record, transcibe, and detect symptoms within the patient during an emergency call. This will hopefully have medical staff spend less time docuemnting and more time with the patients 
themselves. The company's intended customers are all institutions in the medical field. As for some of Corti's competitos they are Nuance Communications, 3M, and NICE. The competitive advantage that Corti has over these 
three is that Corti offers live augumentation features and a better machine learning engine. By utilizing and implemting AI and machine learning, Corti is able to let Audia grow and learn from thousands of phone calls 
that patients have had with their physician. Thanks to Audia, there has been a 46% increase in critical emergencies that have been identified. 

## Landscape 
So, Corti is a company that is in the medical field trying to improve the retention of important information gathered from emergency calls from patients. Some of the biggest improvements and innovations in the medical 
field over the last 5 to 10 years are health care analytics, lower death rates, and an increase in the number of nurse practiciioners. Some of the other major companies in this field are Google Health/DeepMind, Augmedix, 
CloudMedX Health, and Babylon Health. 

## Results
So far, the reults that Corti has managed to obtain are 21% in reduction in average call handling time, 46% increase in critical emergencies identified, and call that recieve feedback have increased by 8x. Corti measures 
success by how many people they have reached and how many diseases they can identify on calls. In 2021, Corti was able to support over 12 million medics over phone calls. Judging by how many people Corti has been able to 
listen to and how the identification rate of critical emergencies has increased ever since Audia was implemented, I'd say that Corti is proving to be quite successful. Compared to its competitors, Corti is performing 
better due to them offering live augmentation features, a better machine learning engine, and better analytical features on top of call-recording. 

## Recommendations
An advise I have for the Corti that they should offer along side of Audia is perhaps also do face time calls. Adding a face time feature and teaching Audia to read facial expressions might give new pieces of information 
about the patient and their health. The technology required would be facial recognition software. Addidng this feature would help the company by potentially detecting an disease or even just a symptom by examining the 
patient's face. This new feature would be perfect for Corti because it would add another way of of helping patients, identifying diseases/symptoms, and aquiring more meaningful data.
